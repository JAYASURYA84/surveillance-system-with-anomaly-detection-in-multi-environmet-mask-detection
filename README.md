# surveillance-system-with-anomaly-detection-in-multi-environmet-mask-detection
This project mainly focus on detecting the mask and no mask.
first run the train mask detector file, so that the model will get trained.
And then run the detect mask video file.Then your monitor camera will turn on then it will start detecting the mask and no mask people.
If you want additional features then run the final file after running train mask detector file.
it will store the frames of people, who does not wear the mask.
 so for that you have to create a seperate folder to store the frames without masks.
  so for training the model you have to collect the dataset.
